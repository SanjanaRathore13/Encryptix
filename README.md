# Encryptix 
Task 2

 Proud to Share My Latest Python Project at Encrptix! 🚀
I had the opportunity to work on a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game using Python. This project enabled me to apply my Python programming skills to create an interactive and user-friendly console game.

The game starts by prompting the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer then generates a random choice using Python's random module. The core game logic determines the winner based on these choices following classic rules:

Rock beats Scissors 🪨✂️
Scissors beat Paper ✂️📄
Paper beats Rock 📄🪨
